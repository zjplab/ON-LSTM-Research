This is the code for our final project. We have modified the original code from https://github.com/yikangshen/Ordered-Neurons to 

- make it runnable under PyTorch 1.x
- add an advanced_test_phrase_grammar.py to support differnt weight combination for unsupervised consitutency parsing 

Note, in order to do colab experiemnt. Part of the code has been uploaded to GitHub by one of our team member Jiapeng Zhang using the Github accout
zjplab, the link https://github.com/zjplab/Ordered-Neurons, which may have some overlap with this code.
